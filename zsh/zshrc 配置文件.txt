# autosuggest-accept: Accepts the current suggestion.
# autosuggest-execute: Accepts and executes the current suggestion.
# autosuggest-clear: Clears the current suggestion.
# autosuggest-fetch: Fetches a suggestion (works even when suggestions are disabled).
# autosuggest-disable: Disables suggestions.
# autosuggest-enable: Re-enables suggestions.
# autosuggest-toggle: Toggles between enabled/disabled suggestions.
# For example, this would bind ctrl + space to accept the current suggestion.
